# README - For the SNU Font LIBrary

This is the module for font reference and download on SNU. Currently, 5 different font formats are supported, they include:

> * Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF)

> * Embeddable OpenType Font format (EOT)

> * SVG Fonts

> * TrueType Font format (TTF)

> * Web Open Font Format (WOFF)

> * No other supported font formats at the moment.

The LIB in library is capitalized on purpose as a way of helping new programmers learn what LIB stands for, as it wasn't as obvious for me, and it took me years before I took the time to realize.
